# Digg Subscriber

Digg Subscriber is a Chrome extension for [Digg](//digg.com/reader),
which allows you to easily add new feeds, one click away!

I made this as a superior alternative to Google's
[RSS subscription extension](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-subscription-extensio/nlbjncdgjeocebhnmkbbbdekmmmcbfjd), specifically for Digg.

## Install

You can install this extension directly from the
Google Chrome webstore by clicking this banner:
